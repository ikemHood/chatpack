/**
 * The demo Chatpack backend used by the copy-paste UI blocks.
 *
 * DESIGN CONSTRAINT that shapes this whole file: the callers are AI-builder
 * previews (Lovable, v0, Shipper, Bolt) running on a DIFFERENT origin, usually
 * inside a cross-site iframe. Third-party cookies are blocked or partitioned
 * there, so the usual `demo_user` cookie recipe cannot be relied on.
 *
 * So this demo authenticates from the URL instead:
 *
 *     https://demo-api.chatpack.dev/api/chat/u/<sandbox>/<userId>/conversations
 *
 * `<userId>` is the demo identity (alice, bob, ...) and `<sandbox>` scopes the
 * data so two unrelated builders never see each other's messages. Both are
 * plain path segments, which means:
 *   - no cookies, no CORS credentials, no `SameSite` puzzle
 *   - `EventSource` works (it cannot send custom headers, but it can fetch a URL)
 *   - a block only has to set the client's `baseURL` + `basePath` once
 *
 * This is a DEMO-ONLY pattern: anyone who knows the URL can act as that user.
 * Real apps resolve a session/JWT in the `auth` hook instead - see llms.txt.
